Query 1: Texas 2021 Winter Storm Blackout
1A. Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

Texas 2021 Winter Storm Blackout [KEY FACTS: 52,000MW peak offline (65% of grid capacity), 4.5M homes lost power, natural gas wellheads/pipelines froze, lasted 4+ days, economic loss $80-130B, 246 deaths]. 

Analyze this blackout using step-by-step reasoning: 
Step 1) Identify primary technical failures in generation and transmission. 
Step 2) Calculate contribution of each factor to the 52,000MW capacity loss. 
Step 3) Trace cascading failure sequence with timestamps. 
Step 4) Quantify market/regulatory gaps. 
Step 5) Synthesize root causes with evidence. 

Base analysis ONLY on provided facts. If uncertain about any metric, output 'VERIFY_SOURCE' in uncertainties array. For each MW/cost figure: cite specific KEY FACT verbatim in 'evidence' field. If calculating/extrapolating: show formula. If KEY FACTS conflict: flag in 'uncertainties' with math showing discrepancy. Consider technical, market, AND institutional factors equally. Avoid single-cause explanations. 

Provide a comprehensive analysis report with the following structure:
1. Executive Summary
2. Primary Technical Failures
3. Capacity Loss Analysis (with MW breakdown by factor)
4. Cascading Failure Timeline (with timestamps and events)
5. Market and Regulatory Gaps
6. Root Cause Synthesis
7. Key Lessons Learned
8. Uncertainties and Data Limitations

Write in clear, professional prose with proper paragraphs and sections. Use headings and subheadings. Include all quantitative data with proper citations to the KEY FACTS. Maximum length: 800 words.
