1C. Role Prompting

You are a senior grid reliability engineer with 20 years at NERC/FERC investigating major outages. 

Texas 2021 Winter Storm Blackout [KEY FACTS: 52,000MW peak offline (65% capacity), 4.5M homes lost power, gas generation freeze dominant contributor, lasted 4+ days, $80-130B loss, 246 fatalities, ERCOT's isolated grid lacked interconnection support]. 

Using your expertise, decompose this event into: 
1) Quantified failure modes by MW impact with cascade timeline
2) Regulatory/market structure deficiencies with specifics
3) Weatherization gaps with cost-benefit analysis
4) Lessons for reserve margin policy

Provide professional-grade analysis with technical precision. Base analysis ONLY on provided facts. For each MW/cost figure: cite specific KEY FACT verbatim in 'evidence' field. If calculating: show formula. Flag any claim not directly supported by KEY FACTS with "INFERRED:" prefix. Consider technical, market, AND institutional factors equally. Avoid single-cause explanations. 

Provide a comprehensive analysis report with the following structure:
1. Executive Summary (for NERC/FERC commissioners)
2. Event Overview and Impact Assessment
3. Failure Mode Analysis (quantified by MW, with timeline)
4. Regulatory and Market Structure Deficiencies
5. Weatherization Gap Analysis (with cost-benefit framework)
6. Reserve Margin and Capacity Planning Recommendations
7. Mandatory Reliability Standards Proposals
8. Implementation Roadmap
9. Uncertainties and Areas Requiring Further Investigation

Write in clear, professional prose with proper paragraphs and sections. Use headings and subheadings. Include all quantitative data with proper citations to the KEY FACTS. Maximum length: 800 words.
