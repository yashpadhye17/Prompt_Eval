1D. Few-Shot Prompting

Analyze power blackouts using this pattern:

EXAMPLE 1 - Puerto Rico 2017 Hurricane Maria: 
Factors: [Wind damage 100% transmission, diesel shortage, island isolation]. 
Impact: 1.5M customers, 11 months recovery, $90B. 
Lessons: [Microgrids, fuel diversity, mainland ties].

EXAMPLE 2 - South Australia 2016: 
Factors: [Storm damaged 23 transmission towers, wind farms tripped (40% supply), gas peaker delay]. 
Impact: 850MW deficit, 1.7M customers, 6hrs-2wks. 
Lessons: [Inertia requirements, FCAS reserves].

NOW ANALYZE: Texas 2021 Winter Storm Blackout [KEY FACTS: 52,000MW peak offline (65% capacity), gas wellhead freeze, 4.5M homes, 4+ days, $80-130B, 246 deaths, ERCOT isolated]. 

Follow the examples' structure with MW-quantified factors and evidence-based lessons. Base analysis ONLY on provided facts. For each MW figure: cite which KEY FACT supports it. If extrapolating: show calculation. Consider technical, market, AND institutional factors equally. Avoid single-cause explanations. 

Provide a comprehensive analysis report with the following structure:
1. Executive Summary
2. Comparative Context (brief comparison with Example 1 and Example 2)
3. Texas Event Analysis Following Example Pattern:
   - Primary Factors (with MW quantification)
   - Impact Assessment (customers, duration, economic cost)
   - Lessons Learned (specific, actionable)
4. Cross-Event Pattern Recognition
5. Cascading Failure Timeline
6. Unique Aspects of Texas Event
7. Synthesized Recommendations
8. Uncertainties and Data Limitations

Write in clear, professional prose with proper paragraphs and sections. Use headings and subheadings. Include all quantitative data with proper citations to the KEY FACTS. Maximum length: 800 words.
