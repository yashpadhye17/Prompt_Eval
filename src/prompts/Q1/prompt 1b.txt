1B. Tree-of-Thought (ToT)

Texas 2021 Winter Storm Blackout [KEY FACTS: 52,000MW peak offline, natural gas production fell 48%, wind turbines iced, coal piles froze, lasted 4+ days, $80-130B economic loss, 4.5M homes, ERCOT isolated grid]. 

Explore THREE parallel diagnostic paths: 
PATH A) Generation failure hypothesis (gas freeze dominance)
PATH B) Transmission/distribution hypothesis (equipment winterization)
PATH C) Market design hypothesis (price caps/reserve margins)

For each path: calculate MW contribution, assess supporting evidence strength (0-1.0), identify contradictions. Then synthesize the most probable multi-factor explanation with quantified contributions. 

Base analysis ONLY on provided facts. If uncertain about any metric, output 'VERIFY_SOURCE' in uncertainties array. For each MW figure: cite which KEY FACT supports it with verbatim quote. If extrapolating: show calculation formula. Consider technical, market, AND institutional factors equally. Avoid single-cause explanations. 

Provide a comprehensive analysis report with the following structure:
1. Executive Summary
2. Path A Analysis: Generation Failures (evidence strength score, MW impact)
3. Path B Analysis: Transmission/Winterization (evidence strength score, MW impact)
4. Path C Analysis: Market Design (evidence strength score, MW impact)
5. Cross-Path Comparison and Contradictions
6. Synthesized Multi-Factor Explanation (with probability weighting)
7. Cascading Failure Timeline
8. Key Lessons Learned
9. Uncertainties and Data Limitations

Write in clear, professional prose with proper paragraphs and sections. Use headings and subheadings. Include all quantitative data with proper citations to the KEY FACTS. Maximum length: 800 words.
