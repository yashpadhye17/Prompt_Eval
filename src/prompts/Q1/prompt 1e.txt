1E. ReAct Prompting

Texas 2021 Winter Storm Blackout [KEY FACTS: 52,000MW peak offline, gas production -48%, 4.5M homes, 4+ days, $80-130B loss, 246 deaths]. 

Use ReAct framework:

THOUGHT 1: Need to identify which generation sources failed and by how much MW.
ACTION 1: Categorize failures: gas (wellhead freeze + pipeline), wind (icing), coal (frozen piles).
OBSERVATION 1: [Calculate MW per source from facts]

THOUGHT 2: Why did cascading happen so rapidly?
ACTION 2: Analyze grid isolation (ERCOT) + cold weather demand spike + simultaneous supply loss.
OBSERVATION 2: [Quantify supply-demand gap with timeline]

THOUGHT 3: What institutional factors enabled this?
ACTION 3: Examine weatherization standards, reserve margins, market design.
OBSERVATION 3: [Identify regulatory gaps]

Continue this cycle through 5-7 thought-action-observation loops until root causes are quantified. Base analysis ONLY on provided facts. For each MW/cost figure: cite specific KEY FACT verbatim. If calculating: show formula. If uncertain about any metric, output 'VERIFY_SOURCE' in uncertainties array. Consider technical, market, AND institutional factors equally. 

Provide a comprehensive analysis report with the following structure:
1. Executive Summary
2. Reasoning Process (showing all THOUGHT-ACTION-OBSERVATION loops sequentially)
3. Synthesis of Findings from Reasoning Loops
4. Quantified Failure Analysis (MW breakdown by source)
5. Cascading Failure Timeline (derived from reasoning)
6. Institutional and Market Failures Identified
7. Root Cause Integration
8. Key Lessons Learned
9. Uncertainties and Data Limitations

Write in clear, professional prose with proper paragraphs and sections. Use headings and subheadings. Include all quantitative data with proper citations to the KEY FACTS. Maximum length: 800 words.
