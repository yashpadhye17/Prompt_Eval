2B. Tree-of-Thought (ToT)

2003 Northeast Blackout [KEY FACTS: 61,800MW offline, FirstEnergy 345kV lines sagged (high load + trees), SCADA alarm failures, 9-minute cascade across 8 states + Ontario, 50M affected, $6B loss]. 

Explore THREE diagnostic paths: 
PATH A) Equipment failure hypothesis (line sag/vegetation dominance)
PATH B) Monitoring/communication hypothesis (SCADA/EMS deficiencies)
PATH C) Coordination failure hypothesis (MISO-PJM-NYISO)

For each path: assess MW impact timeline within 9-minute window, evidence strength (0-1.0), identify contradictions. Synthesize multi-factor explanation with quantified cascade triggers. 

Base analysis ONLY on provided facts. For each MW figure: cite which KEY FACT supports it with verbatim quote. If extrapolating: show calculation formula. If KEY FACTS conflict: flag in 'uncertainties' with math. Consider technical, market, AND institutional factors equally. Avoid single-cause explanations. 

Provide a comprehensive analysis report with the following structure:
1. Executive Summary
2. Path A Analysis: Equipment/Vegetation Failures (evidence strength, MW timeline)
3. Path B Analysis: SCADA/Monitoring Deficiencies (evidence strength, operational impact)
4. Path C Analysis: Interstate Coordination (evidence strength, cascade propagation)
5. Cross-Path Comparison and Contradictions
6. Synthesized Multi-Factor Explanation (with evidence weighting)
7. 9-Minute Cascade Timeline (integrated from all paths)
8. Geographic Propagation Analysis (8 states + Ontario)
9. Post-Event Regulatory Changes
10. Key Lessons Learned
11. Uncertainties and Data Limitations

Write in clear, professional prose with proper paragraphs and sections. Use headings and subheadings. Include all quantitative data with proper citations to the KEY FACTS. Maximum length: 800 words.
