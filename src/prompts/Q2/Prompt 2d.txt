2D. Few-Shot Prompting

Analyze blackouts using this pattern:

EXAMPLE 1 - Italy 2003: 
Factors: [Swiss line tree contact, remaining lines overloaded, split into islands]. 
Impact: 56M people, 27GW, 3-18hrs. 
Lessons: [N-2 planning, inter-TSO protocols].

EXAMPLE 2 - Brazil 2009 Itaipu: 
Factors: [Transmission short circuit, 14GW Itaipu tripped, frequency collapse]. 
Impact: 87M people, 18GW deficit, 2-7hrs. 
Lessons: [Generator protection settings, black start].

NOW ANALYZE: 2003 Northeast Blackout [KEY FACTS: 61,800MW, FirstEnergy 345kV lines to trees, SCADA failures, 9-minute cascade, 50M people, $6B, led to mandatory NERC standards]. 

Match structure with MW-quantified cascade timeline and evidence-based regulatory lessons. Base analysis ONLY on provided facts. For each MW figure: cite which KEY FACT supports it. If extrapolating: show calculation. Consider technical, market, AND institutional factors equally. Avoid single-cause explanations. 

Provide a comprehensive analysis report with the following structure:
1. Executive Summary
2. Comparative Context (comparison with Italy 2003 and Brazil 2009)
3. Northeast Blackout Analysis Following Example Pattern:
   - Primary Factors (with MW quantification)
   - Impact Assessment (people affected, duration, economic cost)
   - Lessons Learned (specific, actionable)
4. Cross-Event Pattern Recognition (vegetation, cascades, coordination)
5. 9-Minute Cascade Timeline
6. Unique Regulatory Outcome (mandatory NERC standards)
7. Synthesized Recommendations
8. Uncertainties and Data Limitations

Write in clear, professional prose with proper paragraphs and sections. Use headings and subheadings. Include all quantitative data with proper citations to the KEY FACTS. Maximum length: 800 words.
