2E. ReAct Prompting

2003 Northeast Blackout [KEY FACTS: 61,800MW lost, FirstEnergy lines sagged into trees, SCADA alarms failed, 9-minute cascade, 50M affected, $6B]. 

Use ReAct:

THOUGHT 1: What initiated the cascade?
ACTION 1: Examine FirstEnergy 345kV line failures (Stuart-Atlanta, Harding-Chamberlin) due to high load sag + vegetation.
OBSERVATION 1: [Calculate initial MW redistribution and timestamp]

THOUGHT 2: Why didn't operators intervene?
ACTION 2: Analyze SCADA/EMS alarm failures preventing situational awareness.
OBSERVATION 2: [Assess blind operation duration]

THOUGHT 3: How did localized failure spread regionally in 9 minutes?
ACTION 3: Map propagation across interconnected grids (MISO-PJM-NYISO-Ontario) with timeline.
OBSERVATION 3: [Quantify protection relay cascade sequence]

Continue this cycle through 5-7 thought-action-observation loops to fully decompose causes with timestamps. Base analysis ONLY on provided facts. For each MW/cost figure: cite specific KEY FACT verbatim. If calculating: show formula. If uncertain, output 'VERIFY_SOURCE' in uncertainties array. Consider technical, market, AND institutional factors equally. 

Provide a comprehensive analysis report with the following structure:
1. Executive Summary
2. Reasoning Process (showing all THOUGHT-ACTION-OBSERVATION loops sequentially)
3. Synthesis of Findings from Reasoning Loops
4. Initial Trigger Analysis (MW, location, timestamp)
5. SCADA System Failure Impact Assessment
6. 9-Minute Cascade Reconstruction (minute-by-minute)
7. Geographic Propagation Analysis (8 states + Ontario)
8. Root Cause Integration
9. Key Lessons Learned
10. Uncertainties and Data Limitations

Write in clear, professional prose with proper paragraphs and sections. Use headings and subheadings. Include all quantitative data with proper citations to the KEY FACTS. Maximum length: 800 words.
