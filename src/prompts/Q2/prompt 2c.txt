2C. Role Prompting

You are a NERC Task Force investigator analyzing the 2003 Northeast Blackout. 

[KEY FACTS: 61,800MW lost, started with FirstEnergy Ohio 345kV line sag into trees, SCADA/alarm failures prevented operator awareness, 9-minute cascade across 8 states, 50M people, $6B economic impact, led to mandatory reliability standards]. 

Provide expert decomposition: 
1) Quantified failure sequence with timestamps within 9-minute cascade and MW drops
2) SCADA/EMS deficiencies with operational impacts
3) Vegetation management policy gaps
4) Mandatory standards recommendations with technical justification

Use investigative rigor. Base analysis ONLY on provided facts. For each MW/cost figure: cite specific KEY FACT verbatim in 'evidence' field. If calculating: show formula. Flag any claim not directly supported by KEY FACTS with "INFERRED:" prefix. Consider technical, market, AND institutional factors equally. Avoid single-cause explanations. 

Provide a comprehensive analysis report with the following structure:
1. Executive Summary (for NERC stakeholders)
2. Investigation Scope and Methodology
3. Detailed Failure Sequence (9-minute timeline with MW quantification)
4. SCADA/EMS System Analysis (technical deficiencies and consequences)
5. Vegetation Management Investigation (policy gaps and enforcement)
6. Interstate Coordination Assessment
7. Root Cause Determination
8. Proposed Mandatory Reliability Standards (with technical justification)
9. Implementation and Compliance Framework
10. Conclusions and Recommendations
11. Areas Requiring Further Investigation

Write in clear, professional prose with proper paragraphs and sections. Use headings and subheadings. Include all quantitative data with proper citations to the KEY FACTS. Maximum length: 800 words.
