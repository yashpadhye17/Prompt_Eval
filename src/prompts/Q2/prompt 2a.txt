Query 2: 2003 Northeast Blackout

2A. Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

2003 Northeast Blackout [KEY FACTS: 50M people affected, 61,800MW lost, FirstEnergy Ohio transmission lines sagged into trees, SCADA/alarm system failures, 9-minute cascade, economic loss $6B, 100+ deaths]. 

Analyze using step-by-step reasoning: 
Step 1) Identify initial trigger event and location with timestamp. 
Step 2) Map cascading transmission failures with MW progression through the 9-minute window. 
Step 3) Calculate contribution of monitoring/communication failures. 
Step 4) Quantify inadequate vegetation management impact. 
Step 5) Assess interstate coordination gaps with evidence. 

Base analysis ONLY on provided facts. For each MW/cost figure: cite specific KEY FACT verbatim in 'evidence' field. If calculating: show formula. If uncertain about any metric, output 'VERIFY_SOURCE' in uncertainties array. Consider technical, market, AND institutional factors equally. Avoid single-cause explanations. 

Provide a comprehensive analysis report with the following structure:
1. Executive Summary
2. Initial Trigger Event Analysis (location, timestamp, technical details)
3. 9-Minute Cascade Progression (MW drops, geographic spread)
4. SCADA/Monitoring System Failures
5. Vegetation Management Deficiencies
6. Interstate Coordination Gaps
7. Root Cause Synthesis
8. Regulatory Impact (mandatory reliability standards)
9. Key Lessons Learned
10. Uncertainties and Data Limitations

Write in clear, professional prose with proper paragraphs and sections. Use headings and subheadings. Include all quantitative data with proper citations to the KEY FACTS. Maximum length: 800 words.
